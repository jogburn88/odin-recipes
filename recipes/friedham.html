    <h2>Description</h1>

    <p>Ham is a processed meat made from pork it was originally created in order to 
        store pork for a long time without refrigeration. The original ham was extremely 
        salty and inedible unless time consuming preperation took place. Most ham in the
        supermarket today is ready to eat out of the package.
    </p>
    <p>This is a simple and tasty way to prepare ham. It would be good to eat with fried eggs 
        or in a sandwich with cheese and a pickle.
